df=sns.load_dataset("titanic")

sns.boxplot(x=df['sex'],y=df['age'],hue=df['survived'])

Observations:

The box plots show the distribution of ages for males and females separately.
For both males and females, the median age of survivors appears to be lower than the median age of non-survivors.
The interquartile range (IQR) for survivors tends to be narrower compared to non-survivors, indicating less variability in ages among survivors.
In general, there seem to be more outliers among survivors compared to non-survivors, especially among females.
Overall, the box plot suggests that younger individuals were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster regardless of gender.
